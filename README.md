# Application Flow
This is a 5 step application. The system manages both the application progression flow and the user's current place within the application - they can come back and be dropped in where they left off.

A user cannot skip any steps, but she is allowed to go back to a previous step without losing her place within the application. When a user goes back to the previous step and submits that page, she will be redirected back to the furthest page within the application that she has seen.

## Install
